## 📌 Description

This Mini CRM Dashboard allows users to manage leads efficiently while visualizing conversion performance.

Instead of using common chart libraries, the project implements a **custom conversion ring and insight system**, making it unique, original, and non-copy.

The primary focus of this project is **product thinking**, **UX clarity**, and **frontend logic**, rather than backend complexity.
